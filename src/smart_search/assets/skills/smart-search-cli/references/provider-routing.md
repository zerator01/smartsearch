## Source Provenance

- `primary_sources`: sources explicitly extracted from the primary model/provider answer.
- `extra_sources`: parallel Tavily / Firecrawl candidates from `--extra-sources`; these are not automatic evidence for the generated `content`.
- `sources`: backward-compatible merged list from `primary_sources + extra_sources`, deduped by URL.
- `source_warning`: non-empty when extra source candidates were appended.
- `extra_sources` are retrieved in parallel and are not automatically used by the primary model to verify its answer.

## Intent Routing Diagnostics

`smart-search route "query"` explains which capabilities the unified `IntentRouter` selected without running providers. It is the right command when the user asks why a prompt triggered docs/current/fetch/vertical routing.

The router output keeps old fields such as `docs_intent`, `zh_current_intent`, `web_current_intent`, `fetch_intent`, and `supplemental_paths`, and adds `intent_router_mode`, `required_capabilities`, `intent_signals`, `confidence`, `router_engines_used`, `degraded`, `degraded_reason`, and `reasons`.

Intent router rules:

- `SMART_SEARCH_INTENT_ROUTER=hybrid|rules|off`, default `hybrid`. `SMART_SEARCH_INTENT_ROUTER` accepts `hybrid`, `rules`, and `off`.
- Optional semantic routing uses `INTENT_EMBEDDING_API_URL`, `INTENT_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`, `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `INTENT_EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD`, and `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MARGIN`.
- Normal users should use the Qwen3-Embedding-8B preset: SiliconFlow endpoint `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/embeddings`, model `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`, threshold `0.475`, and margin `0.053`.
- `smart-search setup` auto-fills threshold/margin when Qwen3-Embedding-8B is selected and no explicit values are already configured.
- Embedding thresholds are model-specific. Run `smart-search route-calibrate --models "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B" --format json` after changing model/endpoint or refreshing the real-query calibration set; use semantic-only Macro-F1 as the primary selector and full-route Macro-F1 as validation.
- Optional model classification uses `INTENT_CLASSIFIER_API_URL`, `INTENT_CLASSIFIER_API_KEY`, and `INTENT_CLASSIFIER_MODEL`.
- `INTENT_ROUTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to `8`.
- Missing or failing embeddings/classifier degrade to rules and should not fail ordinary `search`.
- Semantic matches add a capability only when the top score reaches `INTENT_EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD` and the top-vs-second gap reaches `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MARGIN`; ambiguous semantic matches are recorded as signals only.
- The router returns capabilities only: `docs_search`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, and `vertical_search`.
- Classifier output cannot select providers. Unknown capability names and provider names are ignored.
- `search` and `research` use the unified router. `deep` remains an offline planner and must not call embeddings or classifier components.

## Provider Boundaries

- `search` builds `main_search` from configured peer providers: `XAI_API_KEY` for xAI Responses and `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_URL` + `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` for OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions.
- `search` uses unified `IntentRouter` output to populate `required_capabilities` and `supplemental_paths`; provider execution still follows capability-first fallback.
- `research` reuses the same `IntentRouter` before provider-advantage ordering.
- `deep` uses offline rules/local signals only and must not call remote embeddings or classifier components.
- Official xAI uses the Responses API `/responses` route through `XAI_*`. Compatible relays/gateways use Chat Completions `/chat/completions` through `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_*`.
- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM=true` or `search --stream` sets `stream=true` only for OpenAI-compatible `search` and provider-side `fetch`; it is a relay compatibility switch and does not affect xAI Responses, URL description, or source ranking.
- Legacy `SMART_SEARCH_API_URL`, `SMART_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `SMART_SEARCH_API_MODE`, `SMART_SEARCH_MODEL`, and `SMART_SEARCH_XAI_TOOLS` are unsupported config keys.
- xAI Responses mode may use only `XAI_TOOLS=web_search,x_search` and a subset of those tools.
- Chat Completions mode must not send xAI `web_search` / `x_search` tools or legacy `search_parameters`; xAI Chat Completions Live Search is deprecated.
- The standard minimum profile requires one configured provider in each of `main_search`, `docs_search`, and fetch capability. Missing required capabilities should be treated as a hard configuration failure.
- AnySearch is reported only as optional experimental `vertical_search`; it is not part of general web discovery and is not required by the `standard` minimum profile.
- Jina Reader is `web_fetch` only, not a general search provider. `JINA_API_KEY` is required before Jina satisfies the standard minimum profile; anonymous `r.jina.ai` is explicit/experimental fetch behavior.
- Camofox Browser is `web_fetch` only and is the browser evidence layer for known, selected, dynamic, or blocked URLs. It is not a drop-in replacement for `main_search`, Exa, Context7, Zhipu, or Tavily search indexes.
- Same-capability fallback is allowed; cross-capability fallback is not. Context7 is not used for unrelated broad web queries, and page extraction providers are not used as docs search providers.
- `main_search`: xAI Responses first for Grok/xAI, then OpenAI-compatible answer fallback when that peer provider is separately configured and `--fallback auto` is active.
- `web_search`: Zhipu Web Search API first when routed in, then Zhipu Coding Plan MCP `web_search_prime`, then Tavily / Firecrawl source search when configured.
- `docs_search`: Context7 first for library/API/docs intent, then Exa for explicit docs/API/papers/standards, known-domain/site:, or requested low-noise supplemental discovery.
- Fetch capability: Tavily first, then Jina Reader with `JINA_API_KEY`, then Zhipu Coding Plan MCP `webReader`, then Firecrawl, then Camofox Browser.
- `search` calls Tavily and/or Firecrawl only when `--extra-sources N` is greater than 0.
- With both Tavily and Firecrawl configured, `search --extra-sources N` splits extra sources between them, with Tavily receiving about 60% and Firecrawl the rest.
- `fetch` and known-URL `search "https://..."` use the same fetch fallback chain.
- `fetch` tries Tavily first, then Jina with `JINA_API_KEY`, then Zhipu Coding Plan MCP Reader, then Firecrawl, then Camofox Browser.
- `map` currently uses Tavily only.
- `exa-search` and `exa-similar` use Exa only.
- `context7-library` and `context7-docs` use Context7 only.
- `anysearch-domains`, `anysearch-search`, `anysearch-extract`, and `anysearch-batch` use AnySearch only. Treat results as acceptance evidence until the target vertical domain is reviewed.
- `zhipu-search` uses Zhipu only.
- `zhipu-mcp-search`, `zhipu-mcp-reader`, and `zhipu-mcp-*` zread commands use Zhipu Coding Plan Remote MCP only.
- Runtime config priority is environment variables first, then local config file, then defaults.
- `setup` and `config` read/write the local Smart Search config file and do not call providers.
- `model current` reports explicit provider model settings. `model set` is retained only as a parameter-error migration guard; use `config set XAI_MODEL ...` or `config set OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_MODEL ...` to change models.

Zhipu Web Search API:

- `zhipu-search` corresponds to the official Zhipu Web Search API route, using `ZHIPU_API_URL` plus `ZHIPU_SEARCH_ENGINE`; it is not Zhipu Chat Completions `tools=[web_search]`, not Search Agent, and not the MCP Server.
- `ZHIPU_SEARCH_ENGINE` defaults to `search_std`. Official Web Search API service values include `search_std`, `search_pro`, `search_pro_sogou`, and `search_pro_quark`; keep custom values possible because official services may change.
- `TAVILY_API_URL` only affects Tavily REST calls and does not proxy Zhipu.

Zhipu Coding Plan Remote MCP:

- `ZHIPU_MCP_API_KEY` configures the Coding Plan MCP auth token and must be sent as `Authorization: Bearer ...`; it must never be logged unmasked.
- `ZHIPU_MCP_SEARCH_API_URL` defaults to `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/mcp/web_search_prime/mcp` and calls `web_search_prime` for `web_search`.
- `ZHIPU_MCP_READER_API_URL` defaults to `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/mcp/web_reader/mcp` and calls `webReader` for `web_fetch`.
- `ZHIPU_MCP_ZREAD_API_URL` defaults to `https://open.bigmodel.cn/api/mcp/zread/mcp` and calls `search_doc`, `get_repo_structure`, and `read_file` through explicit repo/docs commands.
- Zhipu Coding Plan MCP must be implemented as a separate Remote MCP-over-HTTP provider layer. Do not route it through the existing `/paas/v4/web_search` Zhipu REST provider.
- A normal Zhipu Web Search API key is not sufficient evidence of Coding Plan entitlement. If `ZHIPU_MCP_API_KEY` is missing or returns auth/provider errors, MCP providers are skipped or fall through within the same capability; zread remains explicit and does not affect the standard minimum profile.
- Provider failures must appear in `provider_attempts` and fallback must remain same-capability.
- `doctor` should report configured/not-configured, auth, rate-limit, provider, timeout, and network status without exposing the MCP token.

Jina Reader:

- `JINA_READER_API_URL` defaults to `https://r.jina.ai`.
- `JINA_API_KEY` is required before Jina satisfies `SMART_SEARCH_MINIMUM_PROFILE=standard`.
- Anonymous Jina Reader calls may be used only as explicit/experimental degraded fetch behavior; they must not make standard setup pass.
- `JINA_RESPOND_WITH=readerlm-v2` requires `JINA_API_KEY` and should report a configuration error without a network request when the key is missing.
- Jina Reader is `web_fetch` only, not `web_search`.
- Jina 401/403, 422, 429, timeout, network errors, and low-quality challenge pages such as `Title: Just a moment...` must be reported as failed provider attempts and allow same-capability fallback.

Camofox Browser:

- `CAMOFOX_BROWSER_FETCH_ENABLED` defaults to `true`.
- `CAMOFOX_MCP_URL` defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:19388/mcp`.
- `CAMOFOX_HEALTH_URL` defaults to the MCP URL with `/mcp` replaced by `/health`.
- `CAMOFOX_AUTH_TOKEN`, `CAMOFOX_TOKEN_COMMAND`, or `CAMOFOX_TUNNEL_SCRIPT` explicitly configures the browser bridge.
- `CAMOFOX_SSH_HOST` is an optional remote token-resolution host.
- `CAMOFOX_FETCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to `75`.
- Camofox can satisfy `SMART_SEARCH_MINIMUM_PROFILE=standard` only when its bridge is explicitly configured and healthy enough to provide browser-visible page evidence.
- Use source discovery -> Camofox verification -> optional Stagehand extraction for discovery-oriented quota fallbacks.

AnySearch:

- AnySearch uses JSON-RPC 2.0 `tools/call` at `ANYSEARCH_API_URL`, default `https://api.anysearch.com/mcp`.
- `ANYSEARCH_API_KEY` is optional. If configured, requests include `Authorization: Bearer ...`; if missing, anonymous requests are allowed.
- `ANYSEARCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` defaults to `30`.
- HTTP 200 responses with `result.isError=true` must return `ok=false`, `error_type=provider_error`, and no successful source results.
- Markdown URL/title/snippet candidates should be parsed into `results`, while raw text remains in `content` and `raw_content`.
- Structured results without URLs must be preserved as raw/structured evidence, not dropped.
- Dotted vertical domain shorthand such as `security.cve` must be normalized to `domain=security` plus `sub_domain=cve` before calling AnySearch.
- `anysearch-batch` accepts at most 5 CLI query strings and returns `error_type=parameter_error` without sending a request when the limit is exceeded.

OpenAI-compatible streaming:

- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM` defaults to `false` and accepts `true`, `1`, or `yes` as true.
- `search --stream` and `search --no-stream` override `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM` for the current invocation.
- Streaming applies only to OpenAI-compatible `search()` and provider-side `fetch()` calls. `describe_url()` and `rank_sources()` stay non-streaming. xAI Responses behavior is unchanged.

Exa domain filters:

- `--include-domains` and `--exclude-domains` accept comma-separated or whitespace-separated domains.
- Both `--include-domains docs.python.org,developer.mozilla.org` and `--include-domains docs.python.org developer.mozilla.org` normalize to the same Exa domain list.
- This normalization is intentional for Windows PowerShell, where an unquoted comma expression can be forwarded through `.ps1` wrappers as a space-separated value.

## Provider Output Details

- Exa HTTP `400` or `422` failures are returned as `ok=false` with `error_type=parameter_error`; use this to distinguish bad CLI/domain/date/category arguments from upstream network failures.
- AnySearch experimental output should preserve structured results without URLs as raw/structured evidence.
- Diagnostic output should report Firecrawl status as whether `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY` is configured; it is not currently a live Firecrawl request.

## Routing Heuristics

- Use `smart-search route "query" --format markdown` when you need to explain why a query maps to `docs_search`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`, or `vertical_search` without executing providers.
- Use `exa-search --include-domains` when official documentation domains are known.
- Use `context7-library` / `context7-docs` for docs/API/SDK/library/framework intent when Context7 is configured.
- Use `zhipu-search` for Chinese, domestic, current, or domain-filtered source discovery when Zhipu is configured.
- Use `exa-search --start-published-date` for recency-constrained source discovery.
- Use `exa-similar` when a known good page is available and adjacent sources are needed.
- Use `search --format content` when a human wants only the generated answer body.
- Use `fetch --format markdown` or `fetch --format content` for user-supplied URLs or when exact page text matters.
- For supplier/directory/procurement expansion, default to main-search candidate discovery and then use `fetch` or Camofox for page evidence. Do not add Exa just to de-noise official/contact/portfolio URLs after successful main search.
- Use `map` before fetching many pages from a documentation site.
- Keep `search --extra-sources` small (`1` to `3`) unless broad coverage is requested.
- For current news or high-risk claims, prefer source discovery plus `fetch`; do not treat broad `search.content` plus `extra_sources` as claim-level verification.

## Maintenance Guardrails

- Provider architecture changes must be verified as distributable CLI behavior, not as behavior that only works because one developer machine has a specific wrapper, shell profile, or local config file.
- Register providers by capability first, then route by intent. Fallback is allowed only within the same capability.
- Keep xAI Responses and OpenAI-compatible as peer `main_search` providers. A failed xAI Responses request may fall back to OpenAI-compatible only when `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_URL` and `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_API_KEY` are separately configured.
- Do not use Context7 for broad news or generic web facts; do not use Tavily, Firecrawl, or Camofox Browser as documentation semantic-search replacements.
- Standard installs must fail closed unless `main_search`, `docs_search`, and fetch capability each have at least one configured provider.
- After provider-routing changes, run source-checkout regression plus `smart-search smoke --mock --format json`. If live keys were used, run a targeted secret scan for exact key substrings before committing.
