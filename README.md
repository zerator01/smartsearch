# smart-search

[简体中文](README.zh-CN.md) | English

CLI-first, skill-driven web research for AI agents and terminal users. `smart-search` gives AI tools one reproducible command layer for live search, source discovery, page fetching, site mapping, provider diagnostics, offline Deep Research planning, and live Deep Research execution.

## What It Is

`smart-search` is not an MCP server. It is a normal CLI that AI agents can call through a skill:

```powershell
smart-search search "latest OpenAI Responses API changes" --format json
smart-search fetch "https://example.com/article" --format markdown
smart-search deep "Compare Responses API web_search with Chat Completions search" --format json
smart-search research "Compare Responses API web_search with Chat Completions search" --format markdown
```

The current architecture has two layers:

| Layer | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| CLI executor | Runs deterministic commands, scenario routing, provider attempts, JSON/Markdown output, local config, smoke/regression checks |
| Skill / AI orchestration | Infers user intent, chooses normal search vs Deep Research, executes planned CLI steps, writes final source-backed answers |

Default `smart-search search` stays fast and live. `smart-search deep` is the explicit offline Deep Research planner. It does not call providers, run `doctor`, or fetch pages by default; it emits a `research_plan` that an AI agent or user can execute step by step. `smart-search research` is the live Deep Research executor: it uses the same planner shape, then runs discovery, fetch/read, gap check, and evidence-only synthesis.

Intent routing now has its own layer. Instead of letting a model pick providers directly, Smart Search first decides the scenario and capabilities needed, then executes the smallest useful workflow:

```text
user query
 -> rules: URLs, explicit docs/current/fetch/vertical signals, strict validation
 -> semantic route: optional embeddings over capability examples
 -> classifier route: optional structured model classification
 -> merged required_capabilities
 -> scenario workflow: discover sources, fetch evidence, optionally extract structure
```

`smart-search route "query"` explains this decision without calling search, docs, fetch, or provider APIs. `smart-search deep` keeps the offline planner contract and uses local/rules signals only.

## Install

Stable channel:

```powershell
npm install -g @konbakuyomu/smart-search@latest
smart-search --version
smart-search setup
```

Test channel:

```powershell
npm install -g @konbakuyomu/smart-search@next
smart-search --version
```

The npm package creates an isolated Python runtime during install. You still use the single `smart-search` command.

Prerequisites:

- Node.js / npm.
- Python 3.10 or newer available as `python`, `python3`, or `py -3` on Windows.

## Quick Start

1. Configure providers:

```powershell
smart-search setup
smart-search doctor --format json
```

2. If OpenAI-compatible `search` hangs or times out, generate the short troubleshooting report:

```powershell
smart-search doctor --format markdown
smart-search diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown
```

3. Run a normal live search:

```powershell
smart-search search "today's important AI news" --validation balanced --extra-sources 2 --format json
```

4. Inspect intent routing without running providers:

```powershell
smart-search route "React useEffect API docs" --format markdown
smart-search route "请核验这个链接里的说法 https://example.com/source" --format json
```

5. Fetch exact page evidence:

```powershell
smart-search fetch "https://example.com/source" --format markdown --output evidence.md
```

6. Plan Deep Research:

```powershell
smart-search deep "Deep research recent Bitcoin market movement" --budget standard --format json
```

7. Run live Deep Research when you want the CLI to execute the staged workflow:

```powershell
smart-search research "Deep research recent Bitcoin market movement" --budget deep --format markdown
```

8. Install the skill for AI tools when setup prompts you, or explicitly:

```powershell
smart-search setup --non-interactive --install-skills codex,claude,cursor,hermes
```

Skill installation writes the bundled `smart-search-cli` skill into user-level tool directories such as
`~/.codex/skills`, `~/.claude/skills`, `~/.cursor/skills`, and `~/.hermes/skills`. It does not initialize
Trellis, hooks, agents, or commands. `--skills-root PATH` is only an advanced override for portable or test installs.

9. After upgrading the CLI, refresh the installed global skill:

```powershell
smart-search skills status --targets codex --format json
smart-search skills update --targets codex --format json
```

`setup --install-skills` remains available for first-time setup. For routine synchronization after package updates, use
`skills status` and `skills update`; they only inspect or overwrite the managed `smart-search-cli` files and do not change
provider keys or create Trellis/hooks/agents/commands.

## Current Architecture

| Capability | Main commands | Providers | Role |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `main_search` | `search` | xAI Responses, OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions | Broad answer generation and synthesis |
| `docs_search` | `context7-library`, `context7-docs`, `exa-search` | Context7, Exa | Official docs, SDKs, APIs, framework/library evidence |
| `web_search` | `zhipu-search`, `zhipu-mcp-search`, intent-routed reinforcement inside `search` | Zhipu Web Search API, Zhipu Coding Plan MCP, Tavily, Firecrawl | Chinese, domestic, current, domain-filtered, or supplementary web discovery |
| `web_fetch` | `fetch`, `zhipu-mcp-reader` | Tavily, Jina Reader, Zhipu Coding Plan MCP Reader, Firecrawl, Camofox Browser | Exact URL content extraction for evidence |
| `vertical_search` | `anysearch-domains`, `anysearch-search`, `anysearch-extract`, `anysearch-batch` | AnySearch (experimental) | Acceptance testing for structured vertical domains such as CVE, finance, legal, academic, and code/docs |
| `site_map` | `map` | Tavily | Site/documentation structure discovery |
| `deep_planner` | `deep` / `dr` | Local planner only | Offline plan generation; no provider call by default |
| `research_executor` | `research` / `rs` | Registered providers by capability | Live staged research: plan, discover, fetch/read, gap check, evidence-only synthesis |

Fallback is scenario-first:

| Scenario | Workflow |
| --- | --- |
| Source discovery | main_search discovers candidate URLs -> scenario APIs reinforce when useful -> Camofox verifies selected pages when quotas or fetch APIs fail |
| Known URL evidence | fetch/extract API reads the selected URL -> Camofox opens the page when API fetch fails, is out of quota, or misses rendered content -> Stagehand extracts structure when needed |
| Dynamic or blocked page | Camofox opens the browser-visible page -> Stagehand extracts task-specific fields when needed |

Provider attempt order is an internal implementation detail and is shown only in debug output. AnySearch is intentionally not part of general web discovery and is not required by the `standard` minimum profile. Use its explicit commands for acceptance and boundary testing before promoting any vertical domain into a future route.

Jina Reader is a `web_fetch` provider only. `JINA_API_KEY` is required before Jina satisfies `SMART_SEARCH_MINIMUM_PROFILE=standard`; anonymous `r.jina.ai` behavior is treated as explicit/experimental fetch behavior and must not weaken fail-closed setup checks.

Camofox Browser is the browser evidence layer for known, selected, dynamic, or blocked URLs. It is not a `web_search`, `docs_search`, or main synthesis provider; when search or docs quotas are exhausted, use the composite workflow: main_search discovers candidate URLs, Camofox fetches/verifies page-visible content, and Stagehand performs structured extraction when needed.

The CLI exposes observability fields such as `routing_decision`, `provider_attempts`, `providers_used`, `fallback_used`, `primary_sources`, `extra_sources`, and `source_warning`.

`routing_decision` keeps backward-compatible booleans such as `docs_intent`, `zh_current_intent`, `web_current_intent`, `fetch_intent`, and `supplemental_paths`, and also includes the unified router fields: `intent_router_mode`, `required_capabilities`, `intent_signals`, `confidence`, `router_engines_used`, and `degraded_reason`.

`extra_sources` are discovery candidates. For high-risk claims, news, policy, finance, health, selection decisions, and serious reviews, fetch key pages first and cite fetched text rather than treating a broad search answer as proof.

Routing rule of thumb: start with `search` for broad discovery and synthesis; use `research` when you want the CLI to execute the deeper evidence workflow; use Zhipu Web Search API for Chinese, domestic, policy, announcements, and current-news searches; use Zhipu Coding Plan MCP only when you explicitly want the Coding Plan quota route; use Context7 first for library/API/framework docs; use Exa only for explicit docs/API/papers/standards, known-domain/site: searches, user-requested low-noise discovery, or when main search fails to produce enough candidate URLs; use Tavily/Firecrawl through `search --extra-sources` for horizontal candidates and through `fetch` for page evidence; use Jina for known-URL extraction; use AnySearch only when you explicitly need experimental vertical-domain search.

## Deep Research

Use normal search when you want a fast answer:

```powershell
smart-search search "React useEffect cleanup docs" --format json
```

Use offline Deep Research planning when you want decomposition before execution:

```powershell
smart-search deep "OpenAI Responses API web_search vs Chat Completions search: which should I use?" --budget deep --format json
smart-search dr "https://example.com/source" --format json
```

Planner output includes:

- `mode="deep_research"` and `query_mode="deep"`;
- `intent_signals`, such as recency, docs/API intent, known URL, claim risk, source authority, and cross-validation need;
- `decomposition`, with 1-6 subquestions depending on budget and difficulty;
- `capability_plan`, choosing from existing CLI blocks;
- `steps[]`, each with `tool`, `purpose`, `command`, `output_path`, and `subquestion_id`;
- `evidence_policy="fetch_before_claim"`;
- `gap_check`, which fetches missing evidence or downgrades unsupported claims.
- `usage_boundary`, which explains that `search` is live, `deep` is offline planning, and execution happens through planned commands.

Deep Research is not a fixed topic recipe system. Market research, product comparison, technical docs, news or policy, claim verification, and URL-first prompts are examples of user language, not required schema enums.

Allowed planned tools are:

```text
search, exa-search, exa-similar, zhipu-search, context7-library, context7-docs, fetch, map
```

`doctor` is preflight, not a research step. `smart-search deep` itself is offline; live research starts when an agent or user executes `steps[].command`.

Use live Deep Research execution when you want the CLI to run the staged workflow:

```powershell
smart-search research "OpenAI Responses API web_search vs Chat Completions search: which should I use?" --budget deep --fallback auto --format json
smart-search rs "https://example.com/source" --fallback off --format markdown
```

`research` runs plan -> discover -> fetch/read -> gap check -> evidence-only synthesis. It defaults to `--fallback auto`, which permits scenario-internal provider retries even when a normal `search` configuration is conservative. `--fallback off` tries only the first provider selected inside each capability, which is useful for debugging provider behavior.

Research JSON includes `final_answer`, `citations`, `evidence_items`, `gap_check`, `provider_attempts`, `fallback_used`, `degraded`, `route_policy_version`, and `evidence_dir`. Discovery snippets are candidates only; citations are produced only from fetched/read evidence. If fallback cannot close a gap, `research` finishes degraded and lists unsupported gaps instead of inventing evidence.

The research router is capability-first plus provider-advantage:

- Context7 first for library/API/framework docs, with Exa reserved for explicit docs/API/papers/standards, known-domain/site: searches, user-requested low-noise discovery, or insufficient main-search discovery.
- Zhipu Web Search API first for Chinese, domestic, current, policy, and announcement searches.
- Zhipu Coding Plan MCP remains a separate quota route through `web_search_prime` and `webReader`.
- Jina is favored for known public URLs, PDFs, and arXiv extraction; ReaderLM-v2 still requires `JINA_API_KEY`.
- Firecrawl is favored for JS-heavy, dynamic, browser-like, OCR/PDF, or robust fallback extraction.
- AnySearch participates only when vertical intent is clear, such as CVE, finance, legal, academic, or codebase/repository searches.

Advanced routing overrides are available through `SMART_SEARCH_RESEARCH_PREFERRED_PROVIDERS` and `SMART_SEARCH_RESEARCH_DISABLED_PROVIDERS`. They can reorder or disable registered providers inside their supported capability, but they cannot move a provider across capability boundaries.

Good user-facing smoke prompts:

```powershell
smart-search deep "深度搜索一下最近的比特币行情" --format json
smart-search deep "OpenAI Responses API web_search 和 Chat Completions 联网搜索怎么选" --budget deep --format json
smart-search deep "帮我核验这个说法是真是假：某某工具已经完全替代 Tavily 做 AI 搜索了" --format json
smart-search deep "https://example.com/source" --format json
```

## Provider And API Key Guide

Use `smart-search setup` for normal configuration. Environment variables remain supported for CI and advanced users.
The default interactive setup wizard includes optional smart intent router prompts, so embeddings and classifier routing can be configured without `--advanced`.

Intent router configuration:

| Key | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SMART_SEARCH_INTENT_ROUTER` | `hybrid`, `rules`, or `off`; default `hybrid` |
| `INTENT_EMBEDDING_API_URL` | Optional OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint for semantic capability routing; recommended setup preset uses `https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/embeddings` |
| `INTENT_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | Optional embeddings API key; masked by `doctor` and config output |
| `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embeddings model name; recommended setup preset uses `Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` |
| `INTENT_EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD` | Semantic route threshold, default `0.74`; recommended 8B setup value `0.475`; model-specific |
| `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MARGIN` | Required top-vs-second semantic margin, default `0.05`; recommended 8B setup value `0.053`; ambiguous matches remain signals only |
| `INTENT_CLASSIFIER_API_URL` | Optional OpenAI-compatible chat-completions endpoint for structured intent classification |
| `INTENT_CLASSIFIER_API_KEY` | Optional classifier API key; masked by `doctor` and config output |
| `INTENT_CLASSIFIER_MODEL` | Classifier model name |
| `INTENT_ROUTER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | Timeout for optional remote router calls, default `8` |

Default `hybrid` is fail-open: if embeddings or classifier settings are missing or fail, routing records `degraded_reason` and falls back to local rules. Semantic routing may add a capability only when the top similarity score is at least `INTENT_EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD` and the top-vs-second score gap is at least `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MARGIN`; otherwise it records an ambiguous signal without adding a capability. The classifier may add capabilities, but unknown capability names and provider names are ignored. Providers are still selected only by capability.

For normal setup, use the Qwen3-Embedding-8B preset: `INTENT_EMBEDDING_API_URL=https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/embeddings`, `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B`, `INTENT_EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD=0.475`, and `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MARGIN=0.053`. `smart-search setup` automatically fills the 8B threshold/margin when the 8B model is selected and those values are not already configured.

Embedding cosine scores are model-specific. Keep `route-calibrate` for advanced re-checks: run it after changing `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, changing embedding endpoints, or expanding the real query calibration set:

```powershell
smart-search route-calibrate --models "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B" --format markdown
```

Use the report's recommended `INTENT_EMBEDDING_THRESHOLD` and `INTENT_EMBEDDING_MARGIN` before judging routing quality. The primary calibration metric is semantic-only Macro-F1; full-route Macro-F1 is reported to verify rules/classifier fallback behavior.

Important boundaries:

- xAI official live search uses the Responses API `/responses` route through `XAI_*`. Compatible relays and gateways use Chat Completions `/chat/completions` through `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_*`.
- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_STREAM=true` or `smart-search search --stream` sets `stream=true` only for OpenAI-compatible `search` and provider-side `fetch` calls. It is a relay compatibility switch for long requests and does not change xAI Responses behavior, URL description, or source ranking.
- Legacy `SMART_SEARCH_API_URL`, `SMART_SEARCH_API_KEY`, `SMART_SEARCH_API_MODE`, `SMART_SEARCH_MODEL`, and `SMART_SEARCH_XAI_TOOLS` are not supported config keys. Use `XAI_*` or `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_*` explicitly.
- `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_TOOLS` defaults to empty. Set it to `web_search` or `web_search,x_search` only for compatible relays that support server-side tools; do not use `web_search_preview` or legacy `search_parameters`. These tools do not fetch result pages automatically; use `smart-search fetch` when page text is required.
- `zhipu-search` support is the Web Search API route, not Zhipu Chat Completions `tools=[web_search]`, not Search Agent, and not the MCP Server.
- Zhipu Coding Plan support is a separate Remote MCP route. `web_search_prime` maps to `web_search`, `webReader` maps to `web_fetch`, and zread tools map to explicit repo/docs discovery commands. It is not mixed into the existing `/paas/v4/web_search` Zhipu REST provider.
- Zhipu Coding Plan MCP requires its own Coding Plan entitlement. A normal `ZHIPU_API_KEY` for Web Search API does not prove `zhipu-mcp-search` or zread access. If `ZHIPU_MCP_API_KEY` is absent or unauthorized, Smart Search skips those MCP providers; the `standard` minimum profile and scenario-internal retries still work through the configured REST/search/fetch providers.
- Jina Reader is not a general search provider. `JINA_API_KEY` is required for Jina to count toward `standard`; `JINA_RESPOND_WITH=readerlm-v2` also requires `JINA_API_KEY`.
- `ZHIPU_SEARCH_ENGINE` defaults to `search_std`. Supported official values include `search_std`, `search_pro`, `search_pro_sogou`, and `search_pro_quark`; custom values remain allowed for future services.
- `TAVILY_API_URL` affects Tavily only. It does not proxy Zhipu. For Tavily Hikari / pooled endpoints, use `https://<host>/api/tavily`; setup normalizes root-host or `/mcp` inputs to that REST base.
- `FIRECRAWL_API_URL` defaults to `https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2`.
- AnySearch uses JSON-RPC 2.0 `tools/call` at `https://api.anysearch.com/mcp` by default. It allows anonymous calls when no key is configured, but authenticated calls send `Authorization: Bearer ...`. HTTP 200 responses with `result.isError=true` are treated as provider errors, not as successful evidence.
- `doctor` and `route` report intent router status, embedding model, threshold, margin, their config source, timeout, and degradation behavior. They do not expose router API keys.

Non-interactive setup example:

```powershell
smart-search setup --non-interactive `
  --xai-api-key "your-xai-key" `
  --xai-model "grok-4-fast" `
  --openai-compatible-api-url "https://api.openai.com/v1" `
  --openai-compatible-api-key "your-openai-or-relay-key" `
  --openai-compatible-model "gpt-4.1" `
  --openai-compatible-stream "false" `
  --validation-level "balanced" `
  --fallback-mode "auto" `
  --minimum-profile "standard" `
  --intent-router "hybrid" `
  --intent-embedding-api-url "https://api.siliconflow.cn/v1/embeddings" `
  --intent-embedding-api-key "your-siliconflow-key" `
  --intent-embedding-model "Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B" `
  --intent-embedding-threshold "0.475" `
  --intent-embedding-margin "0.053" `
  --exa-key "your-exa-key" `
  --context7-key "your-context7-key" `
  --zhipu-key "your-zhipu-key" `
  --zhipu-api-url "https://open.bigmodel.cn/api" `
  --zhipu-search-engine "search_pro_sogou" `
  --zhipu-mcp-key "your-zhipu-coding-plan-key" `
  --jina-key "your-jina-key" `
  --tavily-api-url "https://api.tavily.com" `
  --tavily-key "your-tavily-key" `
  --firecrawl-api-url "https://api.firecrawl.dev/v2" `
  --firecrawl-key "your-firecrawl-key"
```

Minimum profile defaults to `standard`, requiring at least:

- one `main_search` provider: xAI Responses or OpenAI-compatible;
- one `docs_search` provider: Exa or Context7;
- one `web_fetch` provider: Tavily, Jina with `JINA_API_KEY`, Zhipu Coding Plan MCP Reader, Firecrawl, or a configured Camofox Browser bridge.

Missing required capabilities fail closed with a configuration error. Use `SMART_SEARCH_MINIMUM_PROFILE=off` only for local experiments.

Experimental AnySearch configuration is optional and does not satisfy or change the `standard` minimum profile:

```powershell
smart-search setup --non-interactive --anysearch-api-url "https://api.anysearch.com/mcp" --anysearch-key "your-anysearch-key"
smart-search anysearch-domains security --format json
smart-search anysearch-search "CVE-2024-3094" --domain security.cve --max-results 3 --format json
smart-search anysearch-extract "https://example.com/source" --format json
smart-search anysearch-batch "AAPL" "RAG papers" --max-results 2 --format json
```

For vertical domains, the dotted shorthand `security.cve` is accepted by the CLI and sent to AnySearch as `domain=security` plus `sub_domain=cve`. You can also pass the split form explicitly with `--domain security --sub-domain cve`.

Local config path:

- Windows default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\smart-search\config.json`.
- Linux/macOS default: `~/.config/smart-search/config.json`.
- `SMART_SEARCH_CONFIG_DIR` is an advanced override for CI, containers, sandboxes, or portable installs.
- `SMART_SEARCH_RESEARCH_PREFERRED_PROVIDERS` and `SMART_SEARCH_RESEARCH_DISABLED_PROVIDERS` are advanced `research` routing overrides. They accept provider CSV values and can only reorder or disable providers inside existing capability boundaries.
- Earlier Windows source builds defaulted to `~\.config\smart-search\config.json`, while some installs were already pinned to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\smart-search` through `SMART_SEARCH_CONFIG_DIR`. If the new Windows default file is missing but the old home config exists, Smart Search reads the old file as `legacy_windows_home` so upgrades do not lose configuration. `doctor` reports the active path, default path, old home path, `SMART_SEARCH_CONFIG_DIR`, and whether that override merely matches the current default.

Provider timeouts:

- `TAVILY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` controls the Tavily `doctor` connectivity check timeout and defaults to `30`.
- `ANYSEARCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` controls experimental AnySearch JSON-RPC calls and defaults to `30`.
- Raise it for slower Tavily Hikari / pooled / community endpoints before treating the provider as unhealthy.

## Output And Evidence Policy

Use JSON for agents and scripts:

```powershell
smart-search search "query" --format json
smart-search doctor --format json
```

Use Markdown for human-readable reports, detailed diagnostics, source lists, and fetched page text:

```powershell
smart-search doctor --format markdown
smart-search diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown
smart-search smoke --mock --format markdown
smart-search exa-search "OpenAI Responses API documentation" --format markdown
smart-search fetch "https://example.com" --format markdown
```

Use `content` for compact terminal reading:

```powershell
smart-search search "nba report" --format content
smart-search doctor --format content
```

`content` is intentionally brief. Use `doctor --format markdown` for general human troubleshooting, `diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown` for OpenAI-compatible search hangs/timeouts, and JSON formats for complete machine-readable contracts.

Save multi-source evidence under an explicit stable folder. The default uses the platform temp directory; the commands below use a Windows explicit path example:

```powershell
smart-search exa-search "Reuters Iran Hormuz latest" --format json --output C:\tmp\smart-search-evidence\iran-hormuz\01-exa.json
smart-search fetch "https://example.com/source" --format markdown --output C:\tmp\smart-search-evidence\iran-hormuz\02-fetch.md
```

For claim-level evidence:

1. Discover candidate URLs with `search` first; add `zhipu-search` for Chinese/current/domestic tasks, and use `exa-search` / `exa-similar` only for explicit docs/papers/known-domain/adjacent-source needs or insufficient main-search discovery.
2. Fetch exact URLs with `fetch`.
3. Cite fetched text in the final answer.
4. Unsupported key claims must be fetched or downgraded to unverified candidates.

## Troubleshooting

If `doctor` reports `config_error`:

```powershell
smart-search setup
smart-search config list --format json
smart-search doctor --format markdown
```

If OpenAI-compatible `search` hangs or times out after `doctor` passes:

```powershell
smart-search doctor --format markdown
smart-search diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown
```

The diagnose report masks the API key and says whether the problem is missing config, the upstream/relay hanging on the real Smart Search prompt, or a stream/no-stream compatibility mismatch.

If search is slow:

- reduce `--extra-sources`;
- split broad questions into smaller queries;
- use `zhipu-search` for Chinese/current/domestic source discovery, or `exa-search` only for explicit docs/papers/known-domain/low-noise needs, then `fetch` key pages.

If installed CLI health is uncertain:

```powershell
smart-search --help
smart-search --version
smart-search regression
smart-search smoke --mock --format json
```

On Windows npm/mise installs, verify non-ASCII JSON piping:

```powershell
smart-search deep "深度搜索一下最近的比特币行情" --format json | ConvertFrom-Json
```

## Development

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m compileall -q src tests
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest tests -q
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m smart_search.cli regression
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m smart_search.cli smoke --mock --format json
npm test
npm pack --dry-run
```

## Latest stable release notes

### v0.1.14

This stable patch release moves the tested `0.1.13-beta.4` CLI and bundled skill contract into npm `latest`.

- Fixes GitHub issue #7: npm `latest` now includes the `smart-search skills` command expected by the newer installed `smart-search-cli` skill.
- `smart-search skills status` reports whether installed user-level skills are missing, stale, up to date, or contain extra files without writing anything.
- `smart-search skills update` refreshes only the managed bundled `smart-search-cli` files for selected AI-tool targets after a CLI upgrade.
- `smart-search diagnose openai-compatible --format markdown` produces a focused, copy-pasteable troubleshooting report for OpenAI-compatible search hangs/timeouts.
- Docs/API routing now prefers Context7 for library/framework documentation and keeps Exa for explicit docs/API/papers/standards, known-domain/site: searches, or user-requested low-noise discovery.
- README, bundled skill assets, release notes, and tests now document and verify the exact stable package behavior.

## Release lanes

Stable releases use Git tags and npm `latest`:

```powershell
git tag v0.1.14
git push origin v0.1.14
```

Test releases use npm prereleases and do not move `latest`. A push to `main` publishes the next `<package.json version>-beta.N` version under npm dist-tag `next`; `N` resets for each stable base version. To avoid publishing an unwanted beta for a stable bump, the `chore(release): bump version to X.Y.Z` branch commit is skipped by the workflow and the matching `vX.Y.Z` tag publishes npm `latest`. For example, after `0.1.10-beta.1` and `0.1.10-beta.2`, the next `main` publish is `0.1.10-beta.3`.

GitHub Actions also supports manual backfill for historical test builds through `workflow_dispatch`. Use an explicit `target_ref` plus an exact version such as `0.1.9-beta.1`, and publish it with a non-`latest` tag such as `backfill`. npm versions are immutable: old `*-dev.*` packages cannot be renamed in place, only superseded by new `*-beta.N` packages and optionally deprecated later with npm owner credentials.

Stable GitHub releases read optional body text from `.github/releases/vX.Y.Z.md` and append npm package, dist-tag, and workflow-run metadata automatically. Add that file before tagging a stable version so the GitHub Release page explains what changed instead of only listing package metadata.

Release closeout checklist:

1. Verify the registry and tags before changing anything: `npm view @konbakuyomu/smart-search versions --json`, `npm view @konbakuyomu/smart-search dist-tags --json`, and `gh release list --repo konbakuyomu/smartsearch --limit 100`.
2. For historical beta backfill, publish the replacement `*-beta.N` package through Actions with `create_github_release=false` if the workflow token cannot create releases, then create the missing GitHub prerelease locally with `gh release create vX.Y.Z-beta.N --target <commit> --prerelease --latest=false`.
3. Treat npm `E409` during parallel backfills as a registry concurrency failure, not a version-design failure. Re-run the affected version serially after checking whether the package already exists.
4. Do a machine-readable gap check: expected beta versions minus npm versions must be empty, and expected `v*beta*` releases minus GitHub prereleases must be empty.
5. Install the selected test build explicitly, for example `mise use -g "npm:@konbakuyomu/smart-search@0.1.10-beta.3" -y --pin`, then run `mise reshim`, `where.exe smart-search`, `smart-search --version`, `smart-search regression`, `smart-search smoke --mock --format json`, and a non-ASCII JSON pipe such as `smart-search deep "深度搜索一下最近的比特币行情" --format json | ConvertFrom-Json`.
